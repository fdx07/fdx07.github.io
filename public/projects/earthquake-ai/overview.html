<p class="mb-4 text-justify">Trained on the 2015 Nepal quake’s 260 601-building dataset, this three-class neural network converts raw structural and location features into an instant “low / medium / severe” damage map. The balanced model hits about 71 % overall accuracy—enough to steer first-responders toward the worst-hit blocks while the dust is still settling. Check out the full notebook to see the end-to-end pipeline: data audit, class-imbalance fixes, DNN tuning, and the roadmap toward multi-quake, real-time dashboards.</p>
